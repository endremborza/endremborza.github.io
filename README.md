# Endre Márk Borza

I build data infrastructure at research scale, usually from scratch. My main tools are Python, Rust, and Svelte, and I care a lot about code quality and owning what I build. I also teach programming and algorithm design.

More of this in a structured, interactive format at [endremborza.github.io](https://endremborza.github.io/).

## Rankless

My biggest project. [Rankless](https://www.rankless.org/) is a platform for exploring massive scholarly data. Over 3 billion citations among 300 million papers, with complex interactive queries that respond almost instantly. Built with a specialized Rust backend (multi-stage compilation aligned to data shape and size) and a Svelte frontend with hand-rolled SVGs and practically no dependencies. Originally conceived by César Hidalgo at the [Center for Collective Learning](https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/), where I've worked since 2023. Nominated for a [Webby Award](https://www.webbyawards.com/) in 2025.

## Data Science at Lidl

2018–2021 at Lidl's Center of Excellence. We built machine learning systems for demand prediction and algorithms for delivery and distribution optimization that were deployed at European retail scale. Small team, high pressure, production infrastructure (Kubernetes, Kafka, Elasticsearch, CI/CD). Demanding, productive, and formative - I left because I wanted more ownership of my work.

## Research Infrastructure

In 2021 I founded the [Social Science Computing Unit](https://sscu-budapest.github.io/) at the Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, building shared datasets, tooling, and standards for data-intensive research across domains (retail, weather, football, news, chess, real estate). We built [datazimmer](https://github.com/sscu-budapest/datazimmer), [aswan](https://github.com/endremborza/aswan), [parquetranger](https://github.com/endremborza/parquetranger), and several other tools designed for multi-project, multi-year research workflows.

## Research

I contribute to papers through data engineering, pipeline design, and scalable analysis. Topics range from experimental economics to park visitation patterns — the common thread is large, complex datasets that needed efficient processing or creative analysis. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FzM5hAUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) has the list. I also contributed data work to [this book](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/) on data analysis.

## Teaching

Since 2015 I teach at [Rajk College for Advanced Studies](https://rajk.eu): programming, algorithm design, data processing, causal inference. I also guest lecture at Corvinus sometimes. Small classes, motivated students. I was awarded the title of Permanent Professor by Rajk's student community in 2022.

## Open Source & Tools

I've contributed to [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits?author=endremborza), [dask](https://github.com/dask/dask/commits?author=endremborza), [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/commits?author=endremborza), [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/commits?author=endremborza), and [dvc](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/commits?author=endremborza). I build a lot of small tools — parallel IO libraries, entity resolution, [SQL schema visualization](https://github.com/endremborza/sqlmermaid), [interactive explainers](https://endremborza.github.io/funtum-computing/), and various apps for teaching and collective decision-making.
