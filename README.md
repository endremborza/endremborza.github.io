# About

I'm Endre, I work as a junior research fellow at [ANET lab](https://anet.krtk.mta.hu/), which is a multidisciplinary lab of network science, social science and geography. My BA and MA degrees are in economics and I'm taking a rather long road towards CS and ML.
My interests are causality, explainability and symbolic methods in ML, with the aim of utilizing AI to aid a broad spectrum of scientific endeavors from social science to medicine. 

## 2022

I'm running a small team called [Social Science Computing Unit Budapest](https://sscu-budapest.github.io/) where in september of 2021, we started to build a comprehensive data science toolset for scientific research.

Most of it is an ecosystem built around a central dataset and data-project standard/framework currently named [sscutils](https://github.com/sscu-budapest/sscutils).

- [colassigner](https://github.com/endremborza/colassigner) so that we dont use string literals with pandas so much
- [parquetranger](https://github.com/endremborza/parquetranger) to manage - save, load, extend - large datasets in partitioned parquet files
- a task queue orchestrator [atqo](https://github.com/endremborza/atqo)
- raw data collection in [aswan](https://github.com/endremborza/aswan) - named after a dam
- and some python package boilerplate [branthebuilder](https://github.com/endremborza/branthebuilder) so that we can start many others :)
