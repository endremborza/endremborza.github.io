# Endre Márk Borza

This is a more casual, professional history page thing. No grand conclusion, just stuff listed mostly backward chronologically.

## CCL - Corvinus

Started working at [ccl](https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/), mostly on (rankless.org)[https://www.rankless.org/] but also to help others publish papers involving complex data pipelines. I managed to convince our director César (whose idea the site itself actually was) that I'd do the whole thing in Rust and Svelte without any large framework or ready-made tech like react, neo4j, or even anything SQL.

## Research

I worked on the data side of a bunch of papers and one [book](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/), first I got some "thanks" in the acknowledgments, then I started to get [credit as an author](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FzM5hAUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

## Freelancing

Since I primarily work in academia since 2021, I did set up a gig where I can do consulting and development contract work still in the private sector. I find that it is nice to meet challenges that have market value and it's nice to get paid well. I so far did some machine learning modelling and some highly convoluted data-collection. One of the drawbacks next to these great privet sector benefits is that one can't really go into much detail.

## Research Big Data Team @ [KRTK](https://krtk.hun-ren.hu/en/homepage/)

I set up a small team called [Social Science Computing Unit Budapest](https://sscu-budapest.github.io/) where in September of 2021, we started to build a comprehensive data science toolset for scientific research. It slowed down a lot due to a range of issues, mostly around demand, but we did build a central dataset and data-project standard/framework named [datazimmer](https://github.com/sscu-budapest/datazimmer).
With tools like [colassigner](https://github.com/endremborza/colassigner) so that we don't use string literals with pandas so much, [parquetranger](https://github.com/endremborza/parquetranger) to manage - save, load, extend - large datasets in partitioned parquet files, a task queue orchestrator [atqo](https://github.com/endremborza/atqo), raw data collection in [aswan](https://github.com/endremborza/aswan) - named after a dam, and some python package boilerplate [branthebuilder](https://github.com/endremborza/branthebuilder) so that we can start many others :)

We also set up a _lot_ of datasets for research around retail, weather, job-listings, chess, real-estate, football, news articles, interconnected wiki-pages, movies, etc. I'm still working on it as of 2025.

## Lidl

I worked at Lidl as a data scientist. It was interesting, challenging, paid well, I learned a lot. It was a demanding environment with high employee turnover but still high productivity. After a few years, I got tired of not being able to show anything I've done to anybody, and not owning any of the fruits of my labor, so I took a massive paycut and moved to academia.

We developed machine learning for demand prediction and algorithms to optimize delivery and distribution. We were quite successful, a lot of what we did got scaled up and is being used by Lidl widely. I also got to work with professional developers and infra people and gain experience with technologies less frequently used in data science jobs like Kubernetes, Kafka, Elasticsearch, a _lot_ of C/CD and so on. I hope they don't sue me for exposing a few things they use. (Yes, they were this protective of everything)

## Teaching 

In 2015 I started teaching @ [Rajk](http://rajk.eu/home/), and since then have taught courses in Programming and Algorithm Design, Applied Algorithm Design for Data Processing, Statistical Methods for Causal Inference. While I was a guest instructor in machine learning and network science courses, both at rajk and at Corvinus.
Turns out, I quite like teaching, and Rajk, with small classes and generally motivated students, was a great fit. I even got awarded the Permanent Professors of Rajk College title, which might be my favorite thing I've got as an accolade and the one thing I will brag about without anyone asking.

## Lots of Building

I like building things for myself. It mostly helps me learn tools and concepts, but sometimes they turn out to be useful. 

I have attempts to do entity coreference in both [python](https://github.com/endremborza/encoref) and [Julia](https://github.com/endremborza/Encoref.jl), 
a [Julia library](https://github.com/endremborza/BigO.jl) for complexity plotting and estimation, 
[a browser extension](https://github.com/endremborza/scimagojr-search-engine) to search for a scientific journal with one right-click (and then a left click), 
a small [dash app](https://github.com/endremborza/typegame) for creating quizzes for programming education,
docker-based [comparison tool](https://github.com/endremborza/fibonacci_language_comparison) of programming languages, running the same inefficient, recursive Fibonacci counting/printing algorithm, with an interface for guessing results. 

A bunch of apps for [rajk](http://rajk.eu/home/) college, where I spent a wonderful 7 years and got to make tools for resolving preference-based [course applications](https://github.com/rajk-apps/riki), uploading coursework, [credit-card processing](https://github.com/rajk-apps/rajksimple), teaching aids for [presenting](https://github.com/endremborza/teach) or [evaluation](https://jkg-evaluators.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), tinder-like quick evaluation tools for collective decision making. I tried vanilla javascript with google sheets backends and raw PHP 5 and eventually Django. Most of them got the job done at the time, but man they were poorly engineered.

These are mostly some sort of software that all become stale as versions move on. I give less attention to these, but I like looking back on simple things, like an interactive (article)[https://endremborza.github.io/funtum-computing/] explaining quantum states and gates with hand-rolled 3d SVGs of Bloch-spheres, or a (tool)[https://endremborza.github.io/static-snippets/box] that helps my friend figure out how to cut a few pieces of wood to make a house-like bed for my godson.

## Contributions

I think open-source contributions are a great way to learn, and so a while I did a bit of that but lost a bit of interest recently. However, I managed to contribute to [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits?author=endremborza), [dask](https://github.com/dask/dask/commits?author=endremborza), [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/commits?author=endremborza), [julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/commits?author=endremborza), [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/commits?author=endremborza), [dvc](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/commits?author=endremborza).

What was really nice however, is [a project of mine](https://github.com/endremborza/sqlmermaid) that visualizes sql schemas with python even got a PR from a random person. I merged it, it was lovely, since I never really promote any of this.
