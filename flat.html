                                productive. We built machine learning systems for demand prediction
                                and optimization that were rolled out widely.</p>

                                one <a href="https://gabors-data-analysis.com/">book</a>. Over time
                                my role grew from acknowledgments to full authorship.</p>

                                topics vary widely, but the common thread is large, complex datasets
                                that require efficient processing or creative analysis. </p>
                                <p>In
                                parallel, since <b>2015</b> I've been teaching programming,
                                data-heavy methods, and some machine learning mostly in small,
                                motivated settings.</p>

                                <p>The work spans experimental economics,

                                <p>Courses
                                include programming, algorithm design, data processing, and causal
                                inference. I also guest lecture in machine learning and network
                                science. Sometimes at other institutions</p>
                                <p>I enjoy teaching a

                                        <li> Neovim, Linux, LeftWM and a split keyboard for comfort </li>

                                do at least one seriously physically challenging thing every year.</p>

                                StarCraft, D&amp;D and chess. I believe my tastes have developed
                                independently of this, but I definitely enjoy that both chess and
                                StarCraft have been primary playgrounds for AI advancements, both
                                kinds of football have grown immense data science and engineering
                                ecosystems and D&amp;D was the basis for one of the most successful
                                software development efforts I have seen in the XXI. century:
                                Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
                        <!----></div></div><div class="node svelte-snarx8" style="margin-left: 4.5rem;"><h2>D&amp;D</h2> <div><!----><p>I started playing in <b>2020</b>, and it turned out to be one of
                                my primary recreational activities.</p>
                                <p>I find that running a
                                D&amp;D campaign is the ultimate test of any incorporeal inventory
                                and note-taking system. You need to build a world, quickly retrieve
                                information, very quickly input new information, and keep track of
                                the knowledge of the world from the point of view of several PCs and
                                NPCs. After trying a great number of options from the PKM and
                                note-taking space, I settled for the time on <a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq">Logseq</a>,
                                but am constantly building and improving my setup. </p>

                                reviews</a> are public on imdb, <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~endremborza">music</a>
