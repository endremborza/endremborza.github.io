                                <p>This required heavy optimization throughout:

                                Lidl as a data scientist. It was demanding, fast-paced, and
                                productive. We built machine learning systems for demand prediction
                                and optimization that were rolled out widely.</p>

                                <p>Starting in <b>2018</b> at Lidl we developed machine learning
                                models for demand forecasting and algorithms for delivery and
                                distribution optimization.</p>
                                <p>The work scaled well and as far as
                                I know is still in use. I also got deep exposure to production
                                infrastructure: Kubernetes, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and a lot of
                                CI/CD.</p>
                                <p>It was ruthless, difficult, and formative. In a small
                                team, working mostly with developers, and trying to integrate the
                                result of our work into the fine-tuned processes of the massive
                                global behemoth that is Lidl.</p>
                                <p>I eventually left because I
                                wanted more ownership of my work and the ability to show and reuse
                                what I built.</p>
